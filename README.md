Purpose
To gain experience with
•   The solution of problems using linked lists
•   The design of algorithms in pseudocode and their implementation in Java.
1. Task
In this assignment you will design and implement a program in Java to find a path in the map from the last assignment from the Western Power Company (WPC) to the house of the customer C. However, this time your program is required to find a shortest path, if one exists. Your program must use a doubly linked list, as described in the assignment outline.
